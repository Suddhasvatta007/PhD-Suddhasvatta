This repository contains initail results for the Regression Test Selection algorithm using Genetic Algorithm. Below are the steps to run
1. Go the codes folder & upload to your preffered run environemnt (eg: google collab, juypter notebook etc)
2. Go the 'Raw Data' folder; uplaod the file excel and run the 1st block of code 
   2.1. Then in the next block change these two varibales NUMBER_OF_SPECS_SELECTED = 400 (number of requirements in the candidate set for regression testing)
                                                          REG_TIME_Percent = 0.25 (amount of time you want to allocate for regression testing; this is XX% of total time to test NUMBER_OF_SPECS_SELECTED)
3. Run the next block of code for random selection. Note there is loop to run it as many times as you want (chnage it based on your need)
4. Run the next block of code for RTS-GA selection. Note there is loop to run it as many times as you want (chnage it based on your need)
   4.1 This run generates the output excel files
